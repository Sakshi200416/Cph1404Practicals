##  What I Learned About Clean Code

- **Follow SRP (Single Responsibility Principle):** Classes and functions should only do one job.
- **Write clear and descriptive method names:** e.g., `load_projects`, `is_complete`, `update`.
- **Avoid repetition (DRY):** Used helper functions for loading/saving data, menu handling, etc.

##  How to Run

Run any `.py` file directly using Python 3. The main files to test are:

- `language_file_reader.py`
- `myguitars.py`
- `project_management.py`

Ensure related `.csv` and `.txt` data files are in the same directory.
