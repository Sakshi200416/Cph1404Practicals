# Reflection - CP1404 Practical 06

## What did you learn this week?
I learnt how to define and use classes with attributes and methods. I also learnt how to use `__str__`, `__init__`, and custom methods like `is_vintage()` and `is_dynamic()`.

## What was difficult?
Remembering to use `self.` correctly and writing `__str__` method formatting.

## What will you do differently next time?
I will test each part of the class before writing the full program. I will also read the task more carefully.

## How much time did it take you?
Estimated: 2 hours  
Actual: 2.5 hours
